## Solar Panel Energy Calculation

### Description:
The Solar Panel Energy Calculation project is a web-based tool designed to help users estimate the amount of energy generated by solar panels based on various input parameters. The tool calculates the total units of electricity generated by solar panels in a month, taking into account factors such as panel capacity, efficiency, and sunlight hours per day.

### Features:
1. **Input Parameters:** Users can input the following parameters:
   - **Panel Capacity (kW):** The rated capacity of the solar panel system in kilowatts (kW).
   - **Efficiency (%):** The efficiency of the solar panel system expressed as a percentage.
   - **Sunlight Hours per Day:** The average number of hours of sunlight received per day at the installation location.
  
2. **Real-time Updates:** As users adjust the slider controls for efficiency and sunlight hours, the corresponding values are dynamically updated in real-time to provide immediate feedback.

3. **Calculation:** Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the tool computes the total units of electricity generated by the solar panel system in a month using the input parameters provided by the user.

4. **Result Display:** The calculated results are displayed below the input fields, showing the solar panel capacity, efficiency, sunlight hours per day, and the total units of electricity generated in a month.

5. **Material Design:** The user interface of the tool follows the Material Design guidelines, providing a clean and intuitive layout for ease of use.

### Purpose:
The purpose of the Solar Panel Energy Calculation project is to empower users to make informed decisions regarding the installation of solar panel systems by providing them with an estimate of the energy generation potential based on their specific requirements and environmental conditions. Whether for residential or commercial use, this tool serves as a valuable resource for individuals and businesses interested in harnessing solar energy to reduce electricity costs and carbon emissions.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Materialize CSS Framework

### Future Enhancements:
- Integration with geolocation services to automatically retrieve sunlight data based on the user's location.
- Addition of graphical visualizations to illustrate the energy generation trends over time.
- Incorporation of advanced calculations to account for factors such as shading, tilt angle, and panel orientation.

### Conclusion:
The Solar Panel Energy Calculation project offers a user-friendly and informative platform for estimating the energy generation potential of solar panel systems. By providing valuable insights into the expected output of solar energy systems, this tool empowers individuals and businesses to make environmentally conscious decisions and embrace renewable energy solutions.
